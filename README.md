# wine quality prediction
In this project, i've used machine learning to predict the quality of wine.
By analyzing various features like acidity, alcohol content, and color intensity,
our model aims to determine the quality of wine accurately. 
This can help winemakers improve their production processes and ensure consistent quality in their products.
